          <h3 class="subtitle">Intro</h3>
          <p>Nioh 2 is one of my favourite games of all time. It has an interesting story, 
            based on characters and events from the Sengoku period of 16th century Japan in a short
            of alternate history. with deep and complex combat and itemisation systems. With completion 
            of NG+4 and several hundred hours playtime, I believe I have a reasonable understanding of 
            the game mechanics.</p>
            <p>In my quest to understand the underlining mechanics in this game, I have found 
              that there is a lot of conflicting and/or missing information online. Perhaps due 
              to updates and DLC. So, I’ve compiled this guide that is up to date as of Nioh 2 
              - Complete Edition, version 1.28.8 on PC (which is likely to be the final version). 
              It covers New Game - the first playthrough - all the way through NG+++ and the 
              Underworld (endgame). </p>
              <p>This guide aims to equip you with all the knowledge that you need to be effective 
                at Nioh 2 without necessarily holding your hand and telling you exactly what to do 
                in each part of the game. I will forgo explaining basic mechanics of the game as 
                the game does a well enough job of teaching these to you as you play. I will aim 
                to give recommendations as to which things to choose and invest in for the smoothest experience 
                as there is much to pick from. In general, you aren’t ever locked out of anything skill-wise and 
                re-training your stats or skill choices is relatively cheap and easy to do at any point in the game.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-xl-6 sub-section">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Weapons</h3>
          <p><b>Melee Weapons</b></p>
          <p>One of the first choices you will need to make after character creation is what melee 
            weapon(s) you will use. You can hold two weapons at once and can freely switch between both
            weapons on the fly and even completely change weapon types as any time you choose thought 
            the game with no penalty other than needing to gain experience with the new weapon type. </p>
          <p>I encourage you to try out as many weapons as you can to get a feel for which style suites 
            you the most, as they all play a little differently. Each weapon has its own skill tree and 
            unique attack skills and even hidden skills that can be found later in the game. Slower 
            weapons are more suited to being pared with heavier armours for more Toughness (more on 
            this later), while others are faster and favour using lighter amours for better Ki management 
            while dodging more to avoid attacks.</p>
          <p>The game lets you equip two different types (or same type) of weapons at once. I encourage 
            sticking to a single weapon type as the combat system is so deep and complex that learning 
            two weapons initially can be overwhelming. As you play through the game, you may find that 
            your second weapon will often end up being unused in combat and only equipped for a set 
            bonus. This is the simplest way to play and works just fine. </p>
          <p><b>Ranged Weapons</b></p>
          <p>In addition to two melee weapons, you can equip two ranged weapons. Unlike melee weapons, I 
            encourage using two different types of ranged weapons. Ammo is fairly limited and by using two 
            different types you will effectively double your ammo capacity between shrines. I recommend 
            using the combination of a Bow for easy enemies and Musket for enemies with helmets as it 
            pierces helmets where the bow does not. <b>Shooting 'unaware' enemies will grant a massive 
            damage bonus and often one-shot most if hit in the head/weak point. Do this as often as you can.</b></p>

      <h1 class="title">Damage Types</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xl-6 sub-section">
          <h3 class="subtitle">Damage Types and Debuffs</h3>
          <p>As you progress you will find Electricity, Water and Fire elemental effects on weapons and 
            spells. <b>I recommend choosing either Purity or Corruption damage over the elemental 
            types.</b> No enemies resist either of these types and the debuffs they inflict are very strong.</p>
          <p><b>Purity</b></p>
          <p>The Purity status effect increases the Ki damage taken by 50% and prevents any new buffs from being 
            applied. This is great for Onmyo-magic using human enemies as it stops them healing and using barriers/buffs 
            on themselves. The purity debuff will make an enemy take a lot of Ki damage and draining all of a human 
            enemies Ki will open them up for a Finisher. This is good. Finishers do a lot of damage.</p>
          <p><b>Corruption</b></p>
          <p>Corruption on the other hand increases Ki damage taken by 30% and you steal a portion of the Ki damage done to enemies 
              that have this debuff. Additionally, corruption reduces the maximum Ki of Yokai enemies. If the maximum Ki reaches zero, the 
              Yokai will become stunned for a short period. This is very effective against Yokai enemies and Yokai bosses.</p>
          <p><b>Confusion</b></p>
          <p>Combining any two debuffs (Fire/Water/Electricity/Purity/Corruption) will cause the enemy to gain Confusion. This increases 
            all damage taken by 50%. This is multiplicative and one of the highest damage increases in the entire game. This is 
            especially effective against bosses who have significant health pools but also very useful against tougher enemies. Note that 
            Purity and corruption are mutually exclusive: you cannot apply both Purity and Corruption at the same time, but either of these 
            can be combined with Fire, Water or Electricity debuffs to apply Confusion.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Onmyo and Ninjitsu</h1>
          <div class="col-xl-6 sub-section">
            <h3 class="subtitle">Onmyo Magic</h3>
            <p>Magic is very powerful in Nioh 2, in especially the self-buffs that heal and support your character. 
              Magic also works well to provide a second elemental status in addition to your primary weapon for the 
              potent Confusion debuff. I strongly suggest that every character raise the Magic stat (along with ever 
              other stat) to 10 and use Omnyo Magic Talismans.</p>
            <p>Talismans are prepared at any Shrine where you can prepare any number of talismans up to your total 
              capacity, or the maximum capacity of the talisman. A higher Magic stat equals more total capacity, 
              capping at 30 magic). The more talismans you prepare, the more uses you will have and resting at a 
              shine restores all uses.</p>
            <p>I strongly suggest using Barrier Talisman, and if capacity allows: Rejuvenation and/or Extraction 
              Talisman. Barrier provides massive Ki regen, Rejuvenation provides life regen – very useful for 
              countering poison – and Extraction Talisman. Extraction, when combined with Life Recovery (Amrita 
              Absorption), Increased Attack and Increased Defence provide easy access to very useful buffs. All of these 
              talismans are useful for the entire game and work well with any weapon.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xl-6 sub-section">
            <h3 class="subtitle">Ninjitsu</h3>
            <p>Just like Onmyo magic, Ninjitsu is very useful for any character, providing easy ranged damage and strong 
              buffs. It is prepared and used in the same way as Omnyo Magic. By far, the most useful of these being Gunpowder 
              Bomb for easily dealing with enemies that are resistant to physical weapon attacks.</p>
          </div>
        <section id="endgame"></section>
        <h1 class="title">End Game</h1>
          <div class="col-xl-6 sub-section">
            <h3 class="subtitle">New Game Plus (NG+)</h3>
            <p>Each new game cycle has a few new mechanics, higher level enemies with new moves or new enemies added. 
              <b>Ranged enemies fire significantly faster.</b> The most impactful change is the extra damage that you will 
              receive from enemies, so you will want to start thinking about specialising in a particular weapon and 
              unlocking any available Mystic Arts for your weapon, Ninjitsu and Magic. Look for equipment upgrades as 
              you go.</p>
            <p>One of the fastest ways to find upgraded equipment is to <b>kill Revenants early in each game cycle.</b> 
              These will drop high level and upgraded equipment equivalent to the level you would find at the end 
              of the cycle, making the whole cycle easier. They can be difficult to defeat, especially at the start 
              of each cycle, but worth the rewards. Summon Benevolent Spirit assistance if needed as summons won’t 
              impact the rewards.</p>
            <p><b>The fifth cycle, Dream of the Nioh, is entirely optional</b> and so my advice is to skip it entirely and 
              head straight to the Underworld, which is accessible from the start of Dream of the Nioh. It will be 
              quite challenging at the start, but the Amrita earned, and equipment found from the Underworld is so 
              much better than what you will have that it is absolutely worth doing right away.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">The Underworld</h3>
            <p>Upon completion of NG+++ Dream of the Wise, the Underworld will become accessible. This is the ‘end game’ 
              area, consisting of 108 floors. Each floor is fixed in layout, consisting of two parts: the Netherscape 
              (main area) and the Crucible (boss arena). There are always 4 Kodama hidden throughout each Netherscape, 
              that provide buffs when in that floors Crucible.
            <p>Completing a floor’s boss allows you to either continue or progress to the next floor. Progressing this 
              way gives you a chance to enter a Treasure Room instead of the normal floor.</p>
            <p>Clearing Underworld floor 108 grants access to the Depths. These final 30 floors are of significantly higher 
              difficulty, and unlike the underworld are randomly generated.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Ethereal Graces</h3>
            <p>Starting from Dream of the Wise (the fourth new game cycle) Ethereal Graces will start to drop. These are 
              stronger than Divine Graces and are always of Ethereal quality. The most consistent place to obtain graces 
              is in the Underworld. Ethereal graces aren't at all needed before this and I would not recommend farming 
              them before entering. Use Divine graces or sets for the normal NG+ cycles.
            </p>
            <p>Each floor of the Underworld will drop Ethereal Graces from one of the below drop pools, depending on the 
              floor. This starts at p1 on floor 1 then p2 on floor 2 and p3 on floor 3. The cycle then restarts at p1 on 
              floor 4 and continues in that way.</p>
            <p>There are two Ethereal Graces, only found in the Depths floors 6-30. These are Grace of Shinatsuhiko and Grace
