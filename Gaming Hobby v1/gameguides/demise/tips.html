            <h3>General Advice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Strength affects the amount of damage a character does in physical combat. (Giants = best Fighters)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dexterity greatly helps when disarming traps.  Two thieves of the same skill will have different chances 
                    of disarming a trap if their dexterities are different. (Saris = best Thieves)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Intelligence & Wisdom affect the power of your spells. The higher these stats the more damage you will 
                    do with offensive spells, and healing spells will also be more effective. (Elves= best spellcasters)
                </li>
                <li>
                    For every point of Wisdom a character has, 5 spell points will be added to the character's spell point 
                    total.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Charisma is required for charm spells, and a higher charisma makes monsters in the dungeon more likely 
                    to want to join you. (Gnomes = best Magi)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uncursed items with charges can be 'recharged' provided that the object is not consumable. Sell the object 
                    to the store and buy it again, and it will now have a full complement of charges. It is not possible to 
                    recharge: potions, tomes, gems, powders, scrolls, and wands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Items ALWAYS sell for a greater amount of money when fully identified than at any previous level of 
                    identification, EXCEPT if the item is cursed. More money will be made from fully identifying items before 
                    selling them rather than selling them at a low level of identification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, less money is made by identifying companions before selling them. So only identify companions to 
                    find out all information about them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep one of each ‘cursed’ item that you find. Some of these are needed for assigned quests or random 
                    bounties. The store will not stock cursed items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you get the message 'weapon has no effect!', you need to upgrade your weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some monsters can only be harmed by companions or certain weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fountains restore health, the blue balls on pillars restore mana.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restoring spell points at the fountain in the city is far cheaper than restoring HP.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Adventuring Tips</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Keep your HP high.  As your HP decreases, you fight less effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Holding down shift and an arrow key will turn you and then move you forward. 
                    Of course, this has no effect when pressing the forward arrow key.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When lost, you can find yourself by holding down Shift+ Down Arrow.  Your character 
                    will pace back and forth and eventually find themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Large groups of monsters (slaves for example) will block your escape, so be careful 
                    that you do not start venturing down deep in the dungeon too early, because it is quite 
                    likely that you will die. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Magical flight allows you can use the -/+ keys on the keypad to move up/down. (Yes '-' 
                    moves up & '+' moves down) It can still fail over pits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All Slimes are 100% Mind resistant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stone, Paralysis & Drain resistance are some of the most important resistances.  Poison 
                    & Disease resistance are also very useful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Teleporters that require Magical Flight or Displacement to get to usually take you a number 
                    of levels deeper into the dungeon.                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collect: Dusts of Healing, Crystals of Healing (Red), Crystals of Mysticism (Green), Scrolls 
                    of Spells. The healing items are valuable for healing without using mana and scrolls of spells 
                    are great for restoring mana to your spellcasters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep the stack size for the above items to a reasonable amount, as it is possible for a stack 
                    to get stolen or destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When any party member kills a monster required for a guild quest, all members with the quest 
                    for the monster are completed at the same time.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stud Square rooms contain monsters that normally dwell on the level below your current one, 
                    or stronger monsters from your current level. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extinguish squares remove ALL temporary magical effects from the character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each character should equip the guild crest for the currently active guild.
                </li>
            </ol>
