      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <p>
              Demise is a pure dungeon crawler. The aim is to explore the dungeon and defeat the evil therein.
            </p>
            <p>
              In both single player (SP) and multiplayer (MP) you can explore the dungeon in a group of up to 
              four characters. In SP these characters are all created by you, and you have complete control over 
              all of them. In MP, you can only play one character at a time. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There are twelve Guilds (classes) in Demise and character may be a member of more than one guild 
              at a time, but they can only gain experience in their currently active guild. They may switch their 
              active guild in town. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Each guild provides a different set of abilities or spells. Some specialise in combat (Warrior) while 
              others focus on learning spells (Warlock), unlocking chests (Thief) or finding secrets and navigating 
              though the dungeon (Explorer). Certain guilds, however, cannot use certain items. The Warlock guild 
              for example, will not allow their members to wield swords or wear plate armour.

          <h3>My First Character</h3>
          <p>
            The first few levels of the dungeon can be quite dangerous for new adventurers. It is often recommended to 
            start out with a tough brawler character who will have a much easier time than most exploring the first three 
            levels of the dungeon. It’s this character’s job to collect stat boosting tomes and potions for your Legacy 
            (main) character.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Race: Giant</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Class: Warrior</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Stats: 14 Str, 10 Int, 10 Wis, 16 Con, 4 Cha, 12 Dex</strong></p>
          <p>
            Initially keep to dungeon levels 1-3. Use this character to collect stat boosting Potions & Tomes for your 
            legacy (main) character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have collected a total of ~10 Endurance potions or tomes it’s time to make your main character. 
            You can of course keep this brawler character, the giant warrior is a powerful fighter and very 
            durable - more than capable of delving into the deepest depths of the dungeon.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Legacy Character Options</h3>
          <p><strong>1. Good Elf Wizard (Artisan 1-30, Warlock 1-40+)</strong></p>
          <p>Great hit points, Good A/D. Many Spells.</p>
          <p>
            The starting levels in Artisan are well worth it for a spellcaster, providing hit points, A/D and access to items 
            earlier making leveling Warlock much, much easier. Warlocks learn a huge variety of spells to cover almost everything. 
            Your Charming and Healing spells will come from items.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2.	Neutral Dwarf Fighter (Warrior 1-26, Thief 1-10, Explorer 1-10, Warrior 27+)</strong></p>
          <p>Excellent hit points and A/D. Useful Abilites.</p>
          <p>
            Warrior is the best Fighting guild. After gaining max HP, take a dip into the Thief and Explorer guilds for Thieving and 
            Perception abilities as well as Magical Entry, Levitation and Ethereal Portal spells. Switch focus back to Warrior and 
            occasionally level Thief and Explorer as needed for Thieving ability and Resistance spells. Charming, Healing and Blasting
            spells will come from items.

        <h1 class="title">Party Size</h1>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <h3>Going Solo</h3>
            <p>
              A single character, in a single guild is the <strong>by far the fastest way to level.</strong> Less spell points are needed 
              to be used on healing and resistance spells, and a single character needs far fewer items than a party of four to maximise 
              their stats. Companions are highly recommended for solo or small parties - dragons and spellcasters make the best companions 
              to help with horde/swarm clearing.
            </p>
            <h3>Party Play</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike many modern games, in Demise <strong>experience is not shared</strong> between party members. 
              <strong>The only way for a character to gain experience is by damaging and killing monsters.</strong> Therefore, a party 
              of four will need four times as much total experience to level than a solo character and ensure each character is 
              contributing to the damage.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Parties can clear most rooms in fewer rounds, making exploration faster and safer. However, the party will often be 
              limited by the Attack/Defence rating of its weakest member since monsters will often attack the weakest party member. 
              Parties can also be clunky to play - targets of healing/buffs need to be selected manually each and every cast, and 
              you’ll need to frequently re-arrange your party order to ensure that each character is gaining enough experience and 
              one isn’t taking all the kills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The infamous Slot 1 Spellcaster Bug:</strong> Any damaging spell cast from party slots 2, 3 or 4 (not the left 
              most slot) will hit significantly fewer monsters than they are supposed to. Usually damaging less than half of the total 
              monsters that it otherwise should. To get around this, the spellcaster needs to be in slot 1 most of the time.
            </p>
            <h3>Can't it Be Both?</h3>
            <p>
              Perhaps the best way to play then, is with a party of two. This has the benefit of extra offensive power, with 
              only minimal party management and when one character dies, the other can carry their body back to the Morgue for resurrection.
            </p>

        <h1 class="title">How to Not Die</h1>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-xl-8 sub-section">
            <h3>Maximising Hit Points</h3>
            <p>
              Hit points are vital for survival in Demise and large portion of a characters hit points will be gained within the 
              first 30 <strong>character levels</strong>. So, a little planning at the start will make your character much more survivable 
              in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is affected by their chosen class (guild) and Constitution. Warriors gain the most hits-per-level on average, followed by Artisan. 
              Maxing out Constitution at level 1 is strongly recommended as this can mean the difference between 100hp or 200+ hp at level 30. 
              After reaching the MxLv (most guilds around level 25) a character only gains 2hp per level. The extra 100+ hit points can make quite a 
              difference to survivability in the dungeon, especially early on.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>To maximise Hit Points:</strong> Choose a martial guild (rather than a spellcaster) for the first character levels and ensure 
              constitution is at maximum for your race at level 1. If playing a spellcaster, choose Artisan first - switch guilds after level 
              30 Artisan is reached.
            </p>
            <h3>Attack/Defence Rating</h3>
            <p>
              Your Attack/Defence rating determines your ability to hit monsters and avoid being hit in return. Since 
              <strong>a single hit can instantly kill your character</strong>, Attack/Defence ratings are very important. Character level also affects 
              the chance a monster will inflict status effects, such as Poison, Disease, Paralysis or Stone. A high character level and high A/D will 
              make your character nearly untouchable.
            </p>
            <h3>Resistances</h3>
            <p>
              Resistances directly reduce the damage taken by abilities or spells and lower the chances of being affected by status effects. Since 
              spells and monster abilities (such as fire breath and acid spit) cannot miss, resistances are needed to survive these attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only the highest source of a particular resistance is counted. If a character has 50% natural fire resistance and equips an item that grants 30% fire resistance, that character's
              total fire resistance will be the highest modifier - 50%.
            </p>
            <h3>Run Away</h3>
              <p> 
                <i>"The best defense is not being there" -Unknown.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Many monsters can inflict deadly status effects which can deal large amounts of damage, 
                instantly kill or permanently drain statistics and hit points.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Particularly Dangerous Monster Types:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Slimes: Spit Acid, Corrode
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mythical Beasts: Stone
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Undead: Drain, Paralyse
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                It is advised to run from these monster types when encountered, until you have high resistance (at least 50%, ideally 90%), and enough 
                defence and character levels to avoid being hit.

            <h3>Item Restrictions</h3>
            <p><strong>(Class Restricted)</strong> The character must meet the guild and level requirements in the active guild to use or equip that item.</p>
            <p><strong>(Not Class Restricted)</strong> May be used or equipped as long as the character has met the guild and level requirements previously. 
              Notably, Rings, Amulets and Daggers are Not Class Restricted, meaning that a level 30 Artisan can still equip the Dagger of Stealth if they 
              switch guilds to a level 1 Warlock.

              Monsters will occasionally ask to join your party. Press ‘J’ to accept the request. Alternatively, you can force monsters to join though 
              Charm spells - learned through the Magi guild or found on items. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Companions are very useful allies in Demise and can be considered mandatory when playing solo. Companions can take hits for you, kill 
              monsters for you or at least keep them occupied if you get paralysed. Many companions have special attacks that can kill large groups of 
              monsters, or instantly kill a single enemy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You only earn about 25-30% of the experience when companions damage/kill monsters, so companions are best used to ‘finish off’ rooms that 
              your character (or party) isn’t able to deal with in a single combat round. This way you can kill most monsters before they even get a 
              chance to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tips when using companions:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Keep the party size to 6 or less. Any more than this and companions may ‘accidentally’ attack other party members. Typically, 
                does not happen solo.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep companions healed. Just like characters, companions fight better when they have high HP.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep companion bind level up. Companions may leave if their bind level drops too low.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beware of Fright traps! These force companions to leave.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try not to die. Companions leave when you die.
              </li>
              <li>
                The spell ‘Life Domination’ permanently binds a companion to you. Their bind level cannot drop.
              </li>
              
            </ol>
